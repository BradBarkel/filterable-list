## About Me
I primarily use Bitbucket for my projects, so what you'll find here on Github are simple demos, tutorials, and other practice projects I've completed over the years...often moved here in bulk from my local machine when I can find the time.  For my more extensive projects I use Bitbucket for private git repos.  If youâ€™d like to check out some of my other projects, please get in touch.
